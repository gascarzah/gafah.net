Blog Engine powered by Spring Boot
This project is a simple REST application for serving a blog. It uses Spring Boot, Spring Data Mongo, MongoDB and some other helper libraries.

Problem Statement
In its current state, this application only serves blog post details via a GET request at /posts/{id}, where {id} is a post identifier.

Your task is to add a comments feature. The application should be able to serve two new kinds of requests:

POST at /posts/{1}/comments - this should save a new comment for the post matching the submitted {id}
GET at /posts/{1}/comments - this should return all comments for a post matching the submitted {id}
There is a service class CommentService that must be implemented. Review that class to gain more understanding as per the requirements. For each method, there is a javadoc comment that describes the expected behavior.

A subset of tests are currently failing and your solution should result in these tests passing per the requirements presented above.

Remember that the included tests only verify the apps functional correctness. In addition please remember to apply best practices while developing your solution.

Feel free to create and modify files. You are also welcome to add new dependencies, just make certain to modify the appropriate pom.xml. Do not change unit tests, however.

Please follow the conventions used in this project.
